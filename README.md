# Clinical Trials Database
## Overview

The Clinical Trials Database is designed to support the management and documentation of clinical trials. It serves as a centralized system to store and organize information about trials, participants, investigators, medical history, medications, safety data, and more. The goal is to streamline trial operations, ensure compliance with ethical and regulatory standards, and provide reliable data for analysis and reporting.

## Key Features

- Participant Enrollment Tracking – Monitor how many participants are enrolled in each trial.

- Site Performance Evaluation – Track participant visits and site performance to identify strong or weak performing sites.

- Safety Monitoring – Record and track adverse events and safety concerns for participants and medications.

- Progress Tracking – Monitor trial timelines and identify potential delays.

- Compliance Management – Store consent forms and ensure participants meet ethical and regulatory requirements.

- Resource Allocation – Track investigator medications and distribute them efficiently across trials.

- Outcome Analysis – Provide preliminary insights into treatment efficacy and safety.

- Efficient Reporting – Generate required reports for regulatory authorities, sponsors, and ethics committees.

## Business Rules

- One Principal Investigator is assigned to only one clinical trial.

- Each Participant may have only one medical history record.

- Medications can have multiple doses (including placebos).

- A Participant can visit clinics multiple times, and each visit will include an assessment.
